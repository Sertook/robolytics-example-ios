# Robolytics iOS Example

## Note

This project illustrate how to setup [Robolytics](https://robolytics.sertook.com) in your ios app. In
this example we choose to use Firebase to send analytics and to update
our tagging plan. It's not the only way you could achieve this.
Robolytics is fully compatible with any analytics provider.


## Setup

To run the project you have to add your own GoogleService-Info.plist file
from the firebase console into the app folder. You also have to change
the robolytics appId in tha Info.plist by the one you have in
[robolytics console](https://robolytics.sertook.com/console).
